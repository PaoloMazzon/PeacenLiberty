Peace & Libery
==============
by Paolo Mazzon for Ludum Dare #48

Travel across space spreading peace and democracy wherever you roam. Purchase quality weapons
from Rinky's store front, trade stocks in the galaxy's most complex market, and most importantly
travel to different planets and meet the locals while collecting various goods!

Please check the help board in game, there are a fair few mechanics for a game this small.

Special thanks to

 - *Andrew McBride for his "out of this world" (lmao) role as Rinky*
 - Dan & Esteban for a great game idea
 - https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/ for some great gun sounds
