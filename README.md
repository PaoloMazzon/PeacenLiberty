Peace & Libery
==============
by Paolo Mazzon for Ludum Dare #48

Travel across space spreading peace and democracy wherever you roam. Purchase quality weapons
from Rinky's store front, trade stocks in the galaxy's most complex market, and most importantly
travel to different planets and meet the locals while collecting various goods!

Please check the help board in game, there are a fair few mechanics for a game this small.

Roadmap (don't hold your breath)
--------------------------------

 - Enemies give feedback for getting hit
 - Death animation for enemies
 - Unlock framerate
 - Scale weapons with fame
 - More weapons
 - More enemy types
 - Steeper difficulty curve
 - More flavour text
